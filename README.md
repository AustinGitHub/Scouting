# Scouting
Created By Austin Viens-DeRuisseau from Team 79 Krunch
Software Subteam and Scouting Lead
2017

I created this since there are multiple ways to scout but not one definite way. 

<b> How to use it </b> <br /> 
1. Download the file onto your laptop or phone. <br /> 
2. Save it to your gDrive  <br /> 
3. Go to gooogle drive on your phone, recent, then click on the file <br /> 
4. Click open with and then click chrome. <br /> 
5. Once it loads on chrome click the 3 dots next to the tab and click add to home screen <br /> 

By adding it to home screen you can just click on the home screen app it makes and it will instantly load the file within chrome. 

<b> Features </b> 
-  WORKS OFFLINE (Only on android / Tablets and laptops) 
- Saves as csv 
- Saves information locally through localStorage so you can close out of the file, close the browser completely and it will still save the data
- No Security Issues, whereas with google sheets there is a possibility.

<b> Down Fall </b> 
Doesn't work on iPhones because when they did their iOS 9 update, it ruined how you can use this locally.

In the branch Older-Ver is my other ways of doing this but didn't work exactly how we wanted. This took me over 17 hours of research and making and then having to redo the forms each time.
