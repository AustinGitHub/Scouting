<b> <h1> ** THIS IS SET UP FOR 2017 GAME CURRENTLY ** </h1> </b> 
Example - http://team79scouting.orgfree.com/FinalScouting.html
Need to contact me for help with getting it set up email me: aj_viens_deruisseau@yahoo.com 


I created this since there are multiple ways to scout but not one definite way. 

<b> How to use it </b> <br /> 
1. Download the file onto your laptop or phone. <br /> 
2. Save it to your gDrive  <br /> 
3. Go to gooogle drive on your phone, recent, then click on the file <br /> 
4. Click open with and then click chrome. <br /> 
5. Once it loads on chrome click the 3 dots next to the tab and click add to home screen <br /> 
You are now able to access it from your home screen. 

<b> How to CSV </b> <br />
1. Click export to csv at the top of the scouting sheet <br />
2. This will export all the data from the table into a csv. <br />
3. Eemail the csv to the scout lead or whoever is taking charge of scouting <br />
4. Put all the csv files into one folder (should be 6 if 6 people are scouting 1 team each) <br /> 
5. Place the cmd file into that folder, then double click on it <br /> 
6. This will take all 6 or so files and combine them into one file. Top row is excluded from all the others and only keeps one top row, so no need to worry about having the same top row 6 times in one file <br /> 



<b> Features </b> 
-  WORKS OFFLINE (Only on android / Tablets and laptops) 
- Saves as csv 
- Saves information locally through localStorage so you can close out of the file, close the browser completely and it will still save the data
- No Security Issues, whereas with google sheets there is a possibility.

<b> Down Fall </b> <br />
Doesn't work on iPhones/Apple products because when they did their iOS 9 update, it ruined how you can use this locally.

In the branch Older-Ver is my other ways of doing this but didn't work exactly how we wanted. This took me over 17 hours of research and making and then having to redo the forms each time. 


In the near time future I will make this into an app that will perform the same things but will make it work on both devices. 
I will update this sheet with each years game and what the requirements will be for it. 
Again, if you need help feel free to contact me.
